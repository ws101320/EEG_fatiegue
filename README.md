CWSTR-Net: A Channel-Weighted Spatial-Temporal Residual Network
Based on NonSmooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Fatigue
Detection Using EEG Signals

# Installation:
* Python 3.9
* Pytorch 2.0.0+cu118
* Numpy  1.23.5
* Scikit-learn  1.2.1

# Introduce
Offline unsupervised processing for EEG data channel weights.

*The NMFLibrary-master is a pure-Matlab library of a collection of algorithms of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). 

*The nsNMF Channel Weighting Algorithm：algorithmrank1.m 
Adjusting the rank yields different weights.

*Mapping weights to channels for each sample：algorithm.m
